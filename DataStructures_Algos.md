# Cracking the Coding Interview

## 1. Arrays and Strings

## 2. LinkedLists

## 3. Stacks and queues

## 4. Trees and graphs

## 5. Bit Manipulation

### 2's Complement:
-K is represented as concat(1, 2 power N-1 - K) => -3 is represented as concat(1,8-3) = concat(1,5) = 1101, where N is number of bits

### Arithmetic vs Logical right shift:


### Tips: 
1. Addition: When two equal values are added, eg. ```0110+0110``` = (0110)*2 => ```Shift the value left once``` => 1100 
2. Multiplication: 0100*0011 => 0100 is 4 => ```Left shift other value by 2``` => 0011 becomes 1100 
3. XOR: a ^ ~a = ```all 1's``` (x ^ 0 = x, x^ 1 = ~x, x ^ x = 0)
4. Negation: ~0 = ``` All 1's``` => 1111 << 2 => 1100
5. AND: ( x& 0 = 0, x & 1 = x, x & x = x)
6. OR: (x | 0 = x, x | 1 = 1, x | x = x)
